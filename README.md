NOTE: This isn't intended to be used as a botting tool. I've not put in any safeguards to help you get past the anti-cheat system. You'll probably be able to use it for a few minutes before the system catches on. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

It can help a user:
1) Capture names of Pokemon from their screen
2) Match the name with a List of user defined Pokemons.
3) If not matched, then move one spot on the map. Try again with the refreshed Pokemon.
